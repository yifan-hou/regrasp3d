Using the SNOPT mex Files in $SNOPT/matlab
==========================================

 Rename the appropriate precompiled mex interface to match the
 architecture of your machine.
 e.g., on an Intel Mac:
   1. Go to: Applications --> Utilities  and click on the Terminal.app
   2. In the terminal window, cd to the snopt7/matlab directory and type:
          % mv precompiled_snoptcmex.mexmaci snoptcmex.mexmaci


 Run Matlab in the directory $SNOPT/matlab.

 Typing
  >> more on
  >> help Contents
from Matlab provides an overview of the package.

 At the Matlab prompt, type
  >> runAllExamples
This script sets the matlab path appropriately.

 The subdirectory ./examples contains various sample problems
that demonstrate how to use the snOpt Matlab interfaces.  Read
the in-line help information for each m-file for more
information.  To run the individual m-files type

  >> setpath  % if you haven't already called runAllExamples
  >> addpath examples
  >> addpath examples/snmain
  >> snoptmain
